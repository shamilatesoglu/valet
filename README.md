An attempt on a simple, fast and easy to use C++ build system, inspired by Rust's Cargo.

## Status
- [x] Static library projects
- [ ] Dynamic library projects
- [x] Executable projects
- [ ] Prebuilt library dependencies (both static and dynamic)
- [ ] Test targets
- [ ] Benchmark targets
- [ ] Compilation stats (time, memory, etc.)
- [ ] Compilation cache

### Near term TODO
- [ ] Parallel compilation
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary copies during dependency resolution
- [ ] Try to bring down LOC
